# RMIT SCT Falling Ball Workshop

This is the public repository for The School of Computing Technologies workshop on introduction to Algorithmic Thinking and Coding.

This workshop teaches you how to code a simulator in Python that models how objects fall due to gravity.
You'll learn the basics of physics behind free fall (including position, velocity, and acceleration) and how to translate those concepts into code. The workshop will focus on simulating a ball falling and rebounding off the ground, taking into account gravity and energy loss with each bounce. By the end, you‚Äôll have built a simple yet powerful simulation that brings these physical principles to life using Python! üèÄ ‚öΩ

This workshop is based on the Scratch project [Falling Ball](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1106875189/).

This repository steps students through the project in a 1-day tutorial, beginning with starter code in [fall.py](fall.py).

## Setup and Requirements

This tutorial requires the following software:

* Python 3.10+
* [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) library
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE

The linked [Installation](INSTALL.md) instructions install these requirements for Windows and Mac.

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will use code to control what appears on the screen. Coding is how we tell the computer what to do, using a programming language‚Äîin this case, Python. Python is widely used because it is easy to read (the code looks a bit like plain English!) and can be used in many areas. It is used by companies like Google, Netflix, Spotify, and NASA, and across fields like web development, data science, automation, scientific research, game design, and healthcare‚Äîfor things like predictive analytics and image analysis. It works well for beginners and is powerful enough for complex projects. üëç

In this tutorial, we will simulate a **ball falling and bouncing off the ground** ‚öΩ üîΩ We will learn how to position the ball, adjust its motion when falling, and even include gravity and make it lose energy with each bounce. As you go, you will learn how to use basic programming ideas like sequential steps, variables, functions, loops, and if-statements. These are building blocks that can be used to make a wide range of exciting projects.

We will write instructions using functions, which are named blocks of code that do something‚Äîlike moving the ball or drawing on the screen. Functions can take variables as input, which are like labelled boxes that store information we want to use or change. Rather than writing everything from scratch, we can also use libraries‚Äîcollections of functions written by others that we can bring into our own project. Pygame is one such library. It makes it easy to draw on the screen and build interactive projects like animations and simple games.

The tutorial is organised into **10 steps** ü¶∂. Each step adds a new idea and shows how we can use code to describe motion and animate the virtual ball.

The system uses Python and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/about), a toolkit to write games. üéÆ

We have already provided an initial code template in file [fall.py](fall.py). You need to copy-and-paste the contents of this file into your own VSCode folder.

### Step 0: Setup VSCode and the code

To get started with this tutorial, you will need to use VSCode, and get the starting Python code file. To get underway:

1. Open VSCode.
2. Create a new folder where you want your project to be, for example, folder `falling-ball`.
3. Download the file `fall.py` file to your project folder. This can be done by using the download button at the top right corner in the file in GitHub:

    ![](assets/gh-download.png)

    * Alternatively, you create an empty file [`fall.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outreach-csit/falling-ball-public/refs/heads/main/fall.py?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAC5GJNQPCTNCQHAGILHIVDE2Z7SGBWA) with VSCode in your project and then do copy-and-paste; GitHub has s button to copy the file contents into memory:
4. Save the file.

All ready, it is time to run the code. You can do that by clinking the **PLAY** triangle button in the top-right corner of the VSCode window:

![run](assets/vscode-run.png)

You should see the following window, with a ball (or it is a sun? üåû) in the center of the stage:

![](assets/step_00-initial-screen.png)

### Step 1: Set up the screen and draw a ball

In Pygame‚Äîand in most libraries designed for drawing or graphics‚Äîthe screen is like a piece of graph paper. In fact, as you learnt in school, the window created is a **Cartesian plane**, as you learnt in school! As the window is a 2D plane, we refer to a particular point (or location) in it using the `x` and `y` coordinate system. A point is called a "pixel", and we can set each pixel to different colors.

* The top-left corner is `(0, 0)`.
* Moving to the right increases the `x` coordinate. Moving down increases `y`.
* So point `(100, 100)` means 100 pixels across and 100 pixels down.

Let us understand the skeleton code before modifying it. üëÄ

The first two lines tell Python to load and initialize the `pygame` library for building graphical applications and games, and the next two instructions create a clock that will be used to tell Pygame to re-draw the screen at 60 frames/seconds.

```python
import pygame  # Import the Pygame library
pygame.init()  # Set up Pygame

# Set up consistent frame rate
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
FPS = 60  # Frames per second ‚Äì how often the screen updates
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the code, you'll see lines that start with a `#` symbol ‚Äî these are **comments**. They're not run by the computer. Comments are used to explain what each part of the code does, which makes it easier to read later (by others and you in the future!). Always leave comments in your code.

Next, the following code defines the application screen. It will create a display screen of size `1200` (width) by `800` (length) and set its title too:

```python
# Set up the screen
WIDTH = 1200
HEIGHT = 800
SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))  # Create the screen window
pygame.display.set_caption('Falling Ball Simulation :)')  # Window title
```

Here, `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` are the **variables** storing the size of the window we want to create. 

The variable `SCREEN` is the most important one here: it refers to the whole Pygame screen window and we will use it to draw things on it!

> **QUESTION**
> Remember we said that point `(0, 0)` is the top-left one in the screen? Well, our right-bottom pixel will then be `(1199, 799)`. _What would the middle of the screen window be?_


Here is the basic code to open a window and draw a circle (our ball) in the middle. You just need to run it and test it.

You‚Äôll also see **functions** and **variables** in action. For example:

```python
pygame.draw.circle(SCREEN, (250, 160, 30), (ball_x, ball_y), BALL_RADIUS)
```

This line draws a circle on the screen:

- `SCREEN` is where we're drawing it.
- `(250, 160, 30)` is the colour in RGB (red, green, blue).
- `(ball_x, ball_y)` gives the position.
- `BALL_RADIUS` is the size.

In this case, `pygame` is the library, `draw` is the module inside it, and `circle` is the function that does the actual drawing. If you're using VS Code, you can hover over the function name to see what inputs it takes. Or you can search online‚Äîtyping something like ‚Äúpygame draw circle‚Äù into your browser will often give you clear documentation and examples. You can also use the interactive Python shell to explore help functions if you're comfortable doing so.

Here‚Äôs the full code for this step:

```python
"""
- Setup import modules
- Draw screen stage where things will happen
- Draw a circle in a position
"""

import pygame  # Import the Pygame library
pygame.init()  # Set up Pygame

# Set up consistent frame rate
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
FPS = 60  # Frames per second ‚Äì how often the screen updates

# Set up the screen
WIDTH = 1200
HEIGHT = 800
SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))  # Create the screen window
pygame.display.set_caption('Falling Ball Simulation :)')  # Window title

# Constants
BALL_RADIUS = 50  # Size of the ball

# Variables
run = True  # Controls the main loop
ball_x = WIDTH // 2  # Horizontal position of the ball on the screen.
ball_y = HEIGHT // 2  # Vertical position of the ball on the screen.

# Main game loop
while run:
    # Loop through all events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # If the X / close button is pressed, exit the loop
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

    # Draw background and ball
    SCREEN.fill('sky blue')  # Fill the screen with a sky blue background
    pygame.draw.circle(SCREEN, (250, 160, 30), (ball_x, ball_y), BALL_RADIUS)  # Draw the ball

    # Move (not used yet ‚Äì placeholder)

    # Update display and wait to maintain consistent frame rate
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(FPS)  # Delay to keep frame rate steady
```

When you run this, you‚Äôll see a circle drawn in a window.
