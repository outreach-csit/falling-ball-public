# RMIT SCT Falling Ball Workshop

This is the public repository for The School of Computing Technologies workshop on introduction to Algorithmic Thinking and Coding.

This workshop teaches you how to code a simulator in Python that models how objects fall due to gravity.
You'll learn the basics of physics behind free fall (including position, velocity, and acceleration) and how to translate those concepts into code. The workshop will focus on simulating a ball falling and rebounding off the ground, taking into account gravity and energy loss with each bounce. By the end, you‚Äôll have built a simple yet powerful simulation that brings these physical principles to life using Python! üèÄ ‚öΩ

This workshop is based on the Scratch project [Falling Ball](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1106875189/).

This repository steps students through the project in a 1-day tutorial, beginning with starter code in [falling_ball.py](falling_ball.py).

## Setup and Requirements

This tutorial requires the following software:

* Python 3.10+
* [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) library
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE

The linked [Installation](INSTALL.md) instructions install these requirements for Windows and Mac.

## Tutorial

The [Tutorial instructions](Tutorial.md) step students through the workshop activities.

Students start with the [fall01.py](fall01.py) python file.
Students can copy-and-paste the contents of this file into their own VSCode folder.
