# RMIT SCT Falling Ball Workshop

This is the public repository for The School of Computing Technologies workshop on introduction to algorithmic thinking and coding. This workshop is based on the scratch project [Falling Ball](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1106875189/). 

This workshop simulates gravity with a falling ball in Python.
This repository steps students through the project in a 1-day tutorial, beginning with starter code in [fall01.py].

## Setup and Requirements

This tutorial requires the following software:

* VSCode as the IDE
* Python3
* pygame library

The linked [Installation](INSTALL.md) instructions install these requirements for Windows and Mac.

## Tutorial

The [Tutorial instructions](Tutorial.md) step students through the workshop activities.

Students start with the [fall01.py](fall01.py) python file. 
Students can copy-and-paste the contents of this file into their own VSCode folder.
